# Contributing to libredesk-helm

Thanks for contributing! Please follow these two rules:

## 1) Use Conventional Commits
All commits must follow Conventional Commits:

- Format: `type(scope): summary`
- Examples:
  - `feat(chart): add redis values`
  - `fix(values): correct image tag`

See: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

## 2) Work on a Feature Branch
Do not open PRs from `master`. Use a dedicated feature branch in your fork:

- Create a branch: `feature/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`
- Open a PR from that branch into `main`

That’s it
